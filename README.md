#  Data Analysis Project – UCI Credit Card Dataset

##  Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a credit card dataset from Taiwan. The main objective is to understand which customer attributes are associated with the risk of defaulting on a payment in the next month.

The analysis includes:
- Descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables
- Various data visualizations
- Correlation analysis
- Linear regression analysis

##  Setup and Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # for Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate   # for Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶ How to Run

1. **Load the dataset:**
   ```bash
   python load_data.py
   ```

2. **Generate summary statistics:**
   ```bash
   python analyze_data.py
   ```

3. **Generate all visualizations and reports:**
   ```bash
   python data_analysis_main.py
   ```

> All results will be saved in the `plots/` folder and in `.csv` summary files.

##  Methods Used

- Boxplot, Violinplot, Countplot
- Error bars (mean ± std deviation)
- Conditional histograms with hue
- Correlation heatmap
- Linear regression with hue
- Categorical feature analysis (gender, education, marriage)

##  Key Questions Answered

- Which features are most informative for predicting default?
- Are there strong correlations between variables?
- Are there outliers affecting the analysis?
- What is the profile of a typical defaulter?
